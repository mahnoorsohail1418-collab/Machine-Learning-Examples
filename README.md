Machine Learning Examples

This project helps you understand how models are trained, how weights and bias are learned, and how predictions are made.

📊 Models Included
1	Linear Regression	Predicts numerical values	Weight, Bias, Prediction
2	Logistic Regression	Predicts binary outcomes (pass/fail)	Weight, Bias, Prediction, Probability
3	Polynomial Regression	Fits non-linear relationships	Polynomial Coefficients, Bias, Prediction
4	Ridge Regression	Linear regression with L2 regularization	Weight, Bias, Prediction
5	Lasso Regression	Linear regression with L1 regularization	Weight, Bias, Prediction
🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/mahnoorsohail1418-collab/Beginner_Machine_Learning_Examples.git

Navigate into the folder:
cd Beginner_Machine_Learning_Examples

Run the Python script:
python all_regression_examples.py
The script prints weights, bias, and predictions for all 5 models.

⚙️ Requirements
Python 3.x
numpy
scikit-learn
Install dependencies:
pip install numpy scikit-learn

Key Learning Points:
Understand linear and non-linear regression
Learn binary classification with logistic regression
Explore regularization effects using Ridge (L2) and Lasso (L1)
Visualize how weights and bias are adjusted automatically during training
